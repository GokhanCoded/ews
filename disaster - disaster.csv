Georeferenced Community Profile Assessment database,Idea,Disaster Risk Management,Non Global,"Design of a georeferenced database able to contain essential information at village and household level for disaster management purposes, Design of a georeferenced database able to contain essential information at village and household level for disaster management purposes.  This information will be consolidated from in Community Profile Assessments, which should include all the elements needed for disaster preparedness and response; e.g. social aspects (e.g. population, health, education, housing, accessibility) as well as essential resources (e.g. evacuation centres, communication, water and sanitation, power supply).

Understanding Population Movement After the 2018 Central Sulawesi Natural Disasters,Validation,Disaster Risk Management,Non Global,"After the massive earthquake struck Central Sulawesi, Indonesia in September 2018, through a shared value partnership with mobile telecom Digicel, Pulse Lab Jakarta (PLJ) over the past few years has investigated how pseudonymised mobile network data from subscribers in the Pacific region can be used to support evidence-based decision making. From modelling population displacement to understanding changes in citizens behaviour after natural disasters, the research has yielded actionable insights for policymakers and a wealth of experiential knowledge."
"Towards an Understanding of Refugee Segregation, Isolation, Homophily and Ultimately Integration in Turkey Using Call Detail Records",Prototype,Disaster Risk Management,Non Global,"This research contributes with a methodological framework for measuring integration through the lens of spatial and social segregation using CDR data. The study applies this framework using the datasets provided by Türk Telekom. It shows how segregation, isolation and homophily can be measured by deriving population estimates from CDRs, and how the evolution of refugees’ communication patterns and mobility traces can provide initial insights into their social integration."
Computer Vision Flood Forecasting using Remotely Sensed Data,Prototype,Disaster Risk Management,Non Global,"Regional flood forecasting and modelling is a big problem in the hydrological sciences. The issue is even more pronounced in Bosnia and Herzegovina due to inadequate hydrometeorological monitoring network, where only 100 out of 500 rainfall stations remained operational after the war.  The project employs  Remote Sensing to acquire Earth Observations (EO) data, Computer Vision to process the data and Machine Learning (ML) to develop models in order to relate meteorological and other EO data with flooding.

Data Visualization for Household and Building Damage Assessment,Prototype,Disaster Risk Management,Non Global,"One of the most complicated and important components of the recovery process is the rapid and effective restoration of these structures. UNDP has developed a Household and Building Damage Assessment (HBDA) Toolkit to support authorities in crisis-affected countries around the world, to assess residential and non-residential infrastructure and collect timely data to inform decisions. The HBDA will also inform prioritization for risk-informed rehabilitation and rebuilding. Information collected during the HBDA is visualised by Microsoft Power BI,  an intelligence platform used for the analysis and visualisation of data. "
Drones for Social Good (In relation to climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction),Prototype,Disaster Risk Management,Non Global,"UNDP partnered with DJI, the leading drone company from China. The local team is now working with to the Disaster Management Centre and the Maldives National Defence Force to figure out how to get the most out of using drones in disaster planning and relief missions.

For now they have a complete 3D map of Maabaidhoo Island. The map shows where the coast has been eroded at one end and where the soil is protected by a mangrove plantation on the other. For Ibrahim and other community leaders, it offers important clues about which areas would be safest in case another tsunami strikes.

The map only took one day to produce. Yes, there are many more islands to go, and this is just the beginning. Drones alone cannot resolve the challenges brought on by climate change, but they can be a powerful ally for communities on the frontlines."
Using data to save lives in natural disasters,Prototype,Disaster Risk Management,Non Global,"When natural disasters strike, rescue services need to know where people are most at risk. The last population census in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was carried out in 2002, leaving a major gap in population data. This gap can create serious problems during emergencies. For example, during a winter storm in 2012, rescue helicopters were dispatched to remote villages only to discover that nobody was there. Having real-time tools in place could help capture the population’s mobility and ensure that those most-at risk are reached on time. UNDP and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Crisis Management Center have recently completed integrated risk and hazard assessments in each of the 81 municipalities in the country. Using mobile data to complement all this work seemed the natural next step. The way people use mobile phones provides insights into patterns of behaviour on the ground that can be life-saving. The team set out to study whether mobile phone calls could serve as proxy indicators for people’s mobility, as well as to understand how men and women use mobile phones differently (for clues into their diverse levels of vulnerability based on sex-disaggregated data)."
School Mapping Project to help improve emergency preparedness and children's lives around the world,Prototype,Situational Awareness,Global,"The collaboration focused on advancing the School Mapping Project, including enhancements to Magicbox, a software platform that uses real-time data from both public sources and private sector partners to inform life-saving humanitarian responses to emergency situations. Using high-resolution satellite imagery and applying data science tools, the project is being developed with a view to mapping every school in the world. The data is generated and visualized through an online platform that can help identify where gaps and information needs are, serve as evidence when advocating for connectivity and help national governments optimize their education systems. Ultimately, it is designed to help UNICEF Innovation make decisions more quickly, ease the integration of new data, and improve emergency response and resilience against natural disasters and crises."
Epidemic forecasting,Prototype,"Health, Disaster Prediction",Non Global,"Since spring 2018, the Office of Innovation at UNICEF has been working with academic researchers at University of Notre Dame and Boston Children’s Hospital to meld together epidemic modeling approaches with innovative data sets to help the most vulnerable. Together, we developed a forecasting model for Zika in Colombia’s more than one thousand municipalities. In each municipality, we use a basic model that takes into account the environmentally driven nature of Zika virus transmission, and the accumulation of population immunity as the epidemic grows, to generate incidence forecasts"
Data visualizaiton for Disaster Response,Prototype,Disaster Risk Management,Non Global,"The Platform for Real-time Impact and Situation Monitoring (PRISM) assesses the potential risk and forecasts the impact of climate hazards on the most vulnerable communities, in order to design risk reduction activities and target disaster responses. PRISM combines information from satellites and other remote sensing sources with WFP data on vulnerability to create an intuitive, map-based dashboard for improved decision-making in disaster response.
